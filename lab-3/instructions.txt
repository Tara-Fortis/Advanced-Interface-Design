Working With the Bootstrap Accordion

DESCRIPTION

Modify the ScrollSpy page to incorporate an Accordion component.

INSTRUCTIONS

While keeping the Bootstrap documentation page open for the Accordion component as a reference, attempt the below challenges.


Open the page featuring four different categories of cheese that we worked on in class.
Surround the four <section> elements with a <div> that will function as the main Accordion component container.

Modify each of the four <section> elements so that they will each function as an accordion-item.

Within each of the four sections, identify what content will go inside a new <div> element (or some other suitable containing element) for the accordion-collapse.

Inside each of the accordion-collapse <div> elements, nest another element (of your choice) to serve as the accordion-body.
Build out each accordion-header - you may need to move the image of cheese to somewhere inside the accordion-body somewhere and maybe float it to the right side of the page (use one of the utility classes in Bootstrap for this).
Add all of the required class, id, and data-bs-* attributes and values to get the accordion working the way that you think makes most sense.
Try to use some of the navigation Bootstrap components to improve the visual appearance of the navigation panel on the left (a bit of a challenge).


When you are finished, provide a live URL to the working interface (maybe on GitHub Pages) in the submission text area below.
